## Description

This application is a README.md file generator.  I decided to create this application to assist in the process of creating an employer competitive README.  This project is built using node js and npm packages.  Some of the packages we use are the inquire package and the fs package.

## Installation

Make sure you have node js installed first, then in your git bash run the command `npm i`.

## Usage

After running the command `npm i` type `node index.js` in the git bash terminal then answer the prompts that follow.  After you complete all prompts a README file will be generated with the input you provided.
